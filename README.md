🧬 BioDAOTrials
BioDAOTrials is a decentralized smart contract platform designed to streamline and incentivize participation in early-stage biotech research trials. By combining transparent governance with blockchain-based rewards, it empowers researchers, participants, and administrators to collaborate efficiently within a decentralized science (DeSci) ecosystem.

🚀 Features
Trial Proposal
Researchers can propose new biotech trials by submitting details such as the trial title, description, participant rewards, and maximum number of participants.

Admin Approval
A designated admin reviews and approves proposed trials, ensuring quality control before opening enrollment.

Participant Enrollment
Community members can enroll in approved trials, up to the participant limit, enabling broad involvement.

Completion Verification and Reward Distribution
Upon trial completion, researchers or admins verify participants’ contributions and automatically distribute ERC20 token rewards.

Transparent and Traceable
All key actions—trial proposals, approvals, enrollments, and completions—are recorded on-chain, providing an auditable and tamper-resistant history.

🔐 Roles
Admin: Oversees trial approvals and verifies participant completions.

Researcher: Proposes trials and can confirm participant completion.

Participant: Joins trials and earns rewards upon successful completion.

🪙 Token Integration
Rewards are paid out using an ERC20-compatible token, which must be specified at contract deployment. This setup allows flexible integration with existing or custom tokens.

📦 How It Works
Researchers submit detailed proposals for new trials.

The admin reviews and approves proposals.

Participants enroll in approved trials.

Researchers or admin verify participant completion.

Token rewards are automatically distributed to participants.
